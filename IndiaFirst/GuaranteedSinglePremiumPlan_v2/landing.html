											<h3>1. What is the IndiaFirst Life Guaranteed Single Premium Plan?</h3>
											<div class="accordContent">
												<p>This a Non-Linked, Non-Participating, Individual, Single Premium Savings, Life Insurance Plan that provides life insurance cover during the entire policy term. The plan requires a single premium payment by the customer prior to policy inception and gives the benefit of financial protection along with savings in a single policy. This policy will financially protect your loved ones through a life insurance cover in case of an unfortunate event, while providing a guaranteed lumpsum benefit at the end of the policy term.</p>
											</div>
										</div>
										<div class="accord">
											<h3>2. What do you get at the end of the policy term (maturity benefit)?</h3>
											<div class="accordContent">
												<p>On survival up to the end of policy term, you shall receive the Sum Assured on Maturity.</p>
												<p>Where, Sum Assured on Maturity (SAM) is defined as the amount which is guaranteed to be payable on maturity of the policy. SAM is equal to Guaranteed Maturity Multiple (GMM) times Single Premium (excluding any extra premium) where GMM varies with the Age of the life assured, Death Benefit Multiple opted and Policy Term.</p>
												<p>There is an enhancement of maturity benefit factor when paying high premium as per below table –</p>

												<p>The above factors are multiplicative in nature and will be applied on the Guaranteed Maturity Multiple provided in Annexure A.</p>
												<p>The maturity benefit defined above will be paid either as lump sum amount or in monthly instalments over the period of 5 years as opted by the policyholder/nominee at any time during policy period / on death of Life Assured. In case of instalment payment of maturity benefit, the instalment benefit amount will be calculated as dividing lump sum amount (say, S) by annuity factor (i.e. a(n)(12)) i.e. S/a(n)(12) where n is the instalment period of 5 years. The SBI savings bank interest rate as on the beginning of financial year will be used to calculate the annuity factor. The current prevailing SBI savings bank interest rate for FY 22-23 is 2.70% p.a. The interest rate used to calculate annuity factor is subject to review on every financial year and will be changed in case of change in SBI savings bank interest rate.</p>
												<p>The annuity factor defined above will be calculated based on the prevailing SBI savings bank interest rate and once the instalment payment starts, it shall remain level throughout the instalment period.</p>
												<p>On payment of the maturity benefit, the policy will terminate, and no more benefits will be payable.</p>

												<p>Where Sum Assured on Death is defined as: Death Benefit Multiple times Total Premiums Paid.</p>
												<p>The death benefit defined above will be paid either as lump sum amount or in monthly instalments over the period of 5years as opted by the policyholder/nominee at any time during policy period / on death of Life Assured. In case of instalment payment of death benefit, the instalment benefit amount will be calculated as dividing lump sum amount (say, S) by annuity factor ( i.e. a(n)(12)) i.e. S/a(n)(12) where ‘n’ is the instalment period of 5 years. The SBI savings bank interest rate as on the beginning of financial year will be used to calculate the annuity factor. The current prevailing SBI savings bank interest rate for FY 22-23 is 2.70% p.a.
